# Commands Series

This is a series of data packs for Minecraft that add custom commands to the game. This data pack uses [triggers](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/trigger) for it trying to follow the [Data Pack Conventions](https://mc-datapacks.github.io/en/) as close as possible (certification pending). All the triggers on this series are prefixed to avoid issues with other data packs that may add simmilar triggers.

## How to Use

This data pack uses the [/trigger](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/trigger) command that is available when cheats are off. The simplest command looks like this:

```
/trigger my-trigger
```

This example will trigger a score named `my-trigger`. Obviously the triggers on this data packs are more descriptive than this.
